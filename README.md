The Project Report should begin with the group identification and the names and USP numbers of all students in the group. The Project Report has to have the following sections:
Requirements: The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation.
Project Description: Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.
Comments About the Code: Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice.
Test Plan: Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: Selenium, JUnit, Spock), the code for the tests can be used.
Test Results: Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used.
Build Procedures: A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more).
Problems: List any major problems you had.
Comments: Any comments you wish to add.
